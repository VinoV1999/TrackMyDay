This app will help you to track your daily activities and will provide you with insights on how you are spending your time. It can help you to identify areas where you are wasting time and make changes to be more productive. This helped me to become more productive instead of spending on entertainment 6-8% a day.

some of the React Concepts Have Used in this project are listed below
# 1 useState
To store and update data based on the needs, useState hook have been used in almost each JSX pages. 
# 2 useEffect
On load of each page i have to fetch the data that was stored in a firebase. For that, and to keep the timer update after a second useEffect hook concept is used.
# 3 useMemo
While comparing the task activites. There is many possibilities that the user can select a particular task which result in multiple rendering of same data. To avoid the unnecessary rendering useMemo hook was implemented.
 
# 4. Condition Rendering 
To show and hide few components on screen based on the condiition. Have implemented the concept of conditional rendering which helps to render needful components according to the user action.

# 5. Named Export
In authContext.js Named Export concepts have used to just get a practical knowledge.

# Firebase Google Authentication
To authenticate the user have used Firebase Google Authentication. This helps to authenticate the user with their google account.

# Firestore Database
To store the user's activites have used Firebase Firestore Database. This helps to store the user data in the cloud and can be accessed from anywhere with anydevices.

# Chart.js
To show the user's activities in graphical format have used Chart.js. This helps the user to get a clear view on their day to day tasks and easy to understand.
